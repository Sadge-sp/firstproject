<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
We are a team of full time web developers that specialise in making any
type of website with minimalistic design for a below average price. We
can make changes to the site after we are done and will present at least
3 samples before finishing the product. Our team has worked on over 100
sites and can fulfill almost any request made by you. Our usual deadline
is a week. However, we can make the website faster for some extra pay.
All details can be negotiated through our email.
